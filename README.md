# Gregory Day's Code and Project Samples
Thanks for visiting my page.  Below you will find a sample of code and projects that I have worked on in the past. These are meant to demonstrate how I have been able to apply some of my knowledge, skills, and abilities in the past.  I look forward to any feedback.

## Python Code Samples
### [File Transmission - Integration w/ Airplane]
This script runs within the Airplane.dev platform (hence the @airplane decorator). Airplane captures the selections from a JS React table and passes those selections as parameters to this script.  The script then retreives the appropriate files, transfers the files to our 3rd party reporting partners, and executes internal reconciliation tasks. You can view the script by clicking [here.]

###  [Classification - Predicting Coupon Acceptance/Rejection Rate](https://github.com/uscgregory/Classification/blob/main/README.md)

The goal of this binary classification project is to predict whether or not a person will accept a coupon that is recommended to them in different driving scenarios.  This survey describes different driving scenarios including the destination, current time, weather, passenger, etc., and then ask the person whether he will accept the coupon if he is the driver.
